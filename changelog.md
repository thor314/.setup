# Changelog
- 2024-10-09 - major refactor overhaul 
    - script significantly cleaned up and refactored - `00-init.sh` does everything I need to get started
    - at some point, I added some fat hundred megabyte deb file, so I cleaned the git history and restarted history from scratch
    - better logging added in `main.sh` driver
    - this setup script should run in 2 hours or less and generally log failures
    - afterwards section in readme added
    - added `tool-backlog.md`
- 2024-01-26 - I should have a changelog
- 2023-12-24 refactored keybind set script. Test the refactored keybind script more on next install
    - known issue: will not unbind system keybinds, have to do that manually.
